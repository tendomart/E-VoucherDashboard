Redux Action Constants Folder
Path: /src/_constants

The _constants folder contains all of the redux action type constants used by redux action creators and reducers. It could be used for any other constants in the project as well, it doesn't have to be only for redux action types.
Redux Alert Action Constants
Path: /src/_constants/alert.constants.js

The alert constants object contains the redux alert action types used to display and clear alerts in the react application.
Redux User Action Constants
Path: /src/_constants/user.constants.js

The user constants object contains the redux user action types that can be dispatched in the react application, async actions that perform http requests involve a request followed by a success or error response, so each of these three steps is represented by a redux action.
